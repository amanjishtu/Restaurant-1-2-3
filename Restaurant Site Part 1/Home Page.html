								Restaurant is located in the centre of
								Fitzroy Gardens next to the Tudor Village
								and Fairies tree.

								of the Gardens in 1908. This half-timber style
								building is first such facility in the public        
								park. and appears to have been an immediate success. 
								Please come by and visited us soon.
